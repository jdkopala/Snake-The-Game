# Welcome to Snake!

This is a simple clone of the classic Snake made with Python and it's built in graphics engine Turtle.

### How to play

Fork this repo, download the files, navigate to the directory you've saved them to and run the command 
```python main.py``` in your terminal.

Use your arrow keys to move the snake on the screen, run over the green food to extend your snake. Don't touch your tail or the walls though!
